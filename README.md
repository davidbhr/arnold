# arnold

Arnold is a python package to analyze muscle forces using 3D traction force microscopy. It provides interfaces to the open-source finite element mesh generator [`Gmsh`](http://gmsh.info/) and to the network optimizer [`SAENO`](https://github.com/Tschaul/SAENO). 

By assuming a simple cylindircal geometry, traction forces can be computed for single fibers or a series of fibers by individual simulations. Fibers with different geometry can be evaluated for different contraction strains and different tissue environments (*linear* and *non-linear* materials).


A scaling law, derived from such simulation in linear materials, enables computing forces just by the cell geometry, the strain and the material stiffness without the need of further individual simulations.





## Installation

The current version of *arnold* can be installed by cloning this repository or by downloading the zipped version [here](https://github.com/davidbhr/arnold/zipball/master). By running the following command within the unzipped folder, all other required packages are automatically downloaded and installed.

```
pip install -e . 
```




Then the module can be simply imported to python as following

```python
import arnold as ar
```




We still need to set up the interfaces to the open-source finite element mesh generator [`Gmsh`](http://gmsh.info/) and to the network optimizer [`SAENO`](https://github.com/Tschaul/SAENO) .


GMSH offers a python interface within the `Gmsh SDK` , that can be downloaded [here](http://gmsh.info/#Download)
or by simply running the following command: `pip install --upgrade gmsh-sdk`.


To find the equilibrium configuration to the applied boundary problem *arnold* uses the network optimizer [`SAENO`](https://github.com/Tschaul/SAENO). A precompiled version of `SAENO` for 64bit Windows systems can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/davidbhr/arnold/tree/master/docs/SAENO). To build SAENO on other platforms the project can be found [here](https://github.com/Tschaul/SAENO).


Now we need to tell arnold  where `Gmsh` and `SAENO` are stored for one single time. Therefore we simply use:

```python
import arnold as ar

ar.set_gmsh_path(r'C:\..\gmsh-4.3.0-Windows64-sdk')
ar.set_saeno_path(r'C:\..\SAENO')
```

Note: If the `Gmsh SDK` has been installed via `pip` the path to `Gmsh` does not have to be set at all.





## Introduction

A typical measurement can look like the following: Muscle fibers are embedded into a certain matrix environment (e.g. matrigel). Then a contraction is induced via electical stimulation. The deformation can be imaged e.g. via confocal, fluorescence or brightfield microscopy using a high framerate. Beads are embedded to validate that the fibers are attached to the matrix environment and in order to compare the simulated and measured matrix deformations.

*In the Gif below a single flexor digitorum longus fiber embedded in matrigel is shown in the relaxed state and during different stimuli (single pulse stimulation and tetanic stimulaitons with frequencies ranging from 10 Hz to 100 Hz)*

To measure the exerted muscle forces, we need the following information about the respective contraction: 

- The **fiber length** and diameter in relaxed state (can easily be measured from the raw images). 
- The **strain** during the contraction (derived as (Relaxed_Length- Contracted_Length)/Relaxed_Length) 
- The **material properties** of the surrounding matrix (see below for further details)



## Individual Simulation

A simulation can be splitted into three parts:




*__First__*, we need to build a mesh model of the geometry using GMSH. Here the fiber in the relaxed state is simulated as an inner cylindric inclusion with length *l_cyl* and diameter *d_cyl*, which is placed into a sphere with radius *r_outer* that simulates the matrix environment. Units are given in *Âµm* and the *length_factor* allows to tune the fineness of the mesh model (lower values correspond to a finer mesh. The element sizes are increased close to the cylindric inclusion by default)

```python

ar.mesh.cylindrical_inclusion(mesh_file=r'C/../Our_model.msh', d_cyl=30, l_cyl=300,
r_outer=2000, length_factor=0.2)
```

The resulting mesh can be displayed by using the following command:

```python

ar.mesh.show_mesh(r'C/../Our_model.msh')
```

*__Second__*, we apply corresponding boundary condition to our mesh and simulate the contraction of the cylinder using the network optimizer SAENO. We read in the *mesh_file* and apply a symetrical contraction with the given *strain* on the inner cylindrical inclusion with specific length *l_cyl* and diameter *d_cyl*. At the outer boundary of the bulk material we constrain the deformations to zero.


```python
ar.simulation.cylindric_contraction(simulation_folder=r'C/../Simulation', mesh_file=r'C/../Our_model.msh', 
d_cyl=30, l_cyl=300, r_outer=2000, strain=0.1, ar.materials.matrigel_10mg_ml)
```

  "pre-configured" material types for collagen gels of three different concentrations (0.6, 1.2, and 2.4mg/ml). Detailed protocols for reproducing these gels can be found in [Steinwachs et al.

Furthermore, one can define a linear elastic material with a specified `stiffness` (in Pa) with:

 
  * To define a non-linear elastic material by it's linear stiffness use:
 
```python
ar.materials.linear_stiffness()
```

  * To define a specific youngs modulus for a linear-elastic hydrogel (such as Matrigel) with a poission ratio of 0.25 (see  [Steinwachs                 et al. (2016)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3685)) use 

```python
ar.materials.youngs_modulus()
````
  * To define non-linear materials use the `custom` material type:

```python
jf.materials.custom(K_0, D_0, L_S, D_S)
```
   Non-linear materials are characterized by four parameters:
 - `K_0`: the linear stiffness (in Pa)
 - `D_0`: the rate of stiffness variation during fiber buckling
 - `L_S`: the onset strain for strain stiffening
 - `D_S`: the rate of stiffness variation during strain stiffening
   
   A full description of the non-linear material model and the parameters can be found in [Steinwachs et al. (2016)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3685))



The results are stored in the given *simulation_folder*. For the set deformations at the fiber surface we obtain the respective forces, in the bulk material we obtain the corresponding deformations, which compensate for these forces. More information output files of a simulation can be found the [Wiki of the SAENO project](https://github.com/Tschaul/SAENO/wiki). The file `parameters.txt` contains all set parameters used in the simulation.








*__Third__*, we compute the overall contractility from the resultin simulation (by summing up). 

```python
ar.force.reconstruct_contractility(simulation_folder=r'C/../Simulation', d_cyl=30, l_cyl=300, r_outer=2000)
```

We receive a excel document contrctilities. contractility mean x components gves us of contractility of muscefiber only taking x components into account (possible noise errors..) and half of cell (due magdeburger halkugeln..). Also store contractility derived from absolute vectors instead of x components and over whole area instead of half. Additionally residuum forces are calculated to check validity of simulation. For visualization and possible error detection an image of the deformtion and force field is stored.

*__All three abovementioned steps can be performed consecutively by using a single command. For an individual simulation just you just need to execute the combined function:__*

```python

ar.experiment.cylindrical_inclusion_mesh_simulation_and_contractility(mesh_file=r'C/../Our_model.msh', 
d_cyl=30,l_cyl=300, r_outer=2000, length_factor=0.2, simulation_folder=r'C/../Simulation', 
strain=0.1, ar.materials.matrigel10)
```
Note: *mesh_file* and *simulation_folder* now only describe the desired directory and are created and used automatically.
